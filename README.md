# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my digital portfolio for **ECON 5200: Applied Data Analytics in Economics**.  
This repository documents my journey in applying modern data analytics tools to economic questions, with a focus on clear reasoning, empirical rigor, and practical implementation.

## About This Portfolio

I am an undergraduate economics student actively preparing for **data analysis–focused roles**. Through this course, I am developing the ability to bridge **traditional economic theory** with **modern data science methods**.

This portfolio reflects a *concept extension* approach to learning: we begin with foundational ideas from statistics and econometrics—such as linear regression, inference, and causal reasoning—and extend them using machine learning techniques like regularization and model selection. The goal is not to replace economic intuition, but to strengthen it by combining **causal inference** with **predictive analytics**.

All projects and labs in this repository emphasize interpretability, reproducibility, and thoughtful model use in an economic context.

## Concept Extension — Return-Aware Experimentation

In return-aware experimentation, as practiced at :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, decision thresholds are optimized around expected business value rather than fixed statistical conventions. Unlike the academic standard of *p* < 0.05—which treats all errors symmetrically—return-aware frameworks explicitly weigh the cost of false positives against the opportunity cost of delayed action. This reframes significance levels as tunable parameters aligned with revenue impact, user experience, and risk tolerance. In practice, statistical evidence is necessary but not sufficient—the final threshold is a business decision, not a universal scientific constant.
